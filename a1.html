              Kenyan Hip-Hop Artist Octopizzo on the Power of Music and

            <p class="small-italic">- words by Sawsen Khechab</p>
            <p class="small-italic">Interviewed and edited by Ka Man Mak</p>
            <p class="article-para">
              From his home in Nairobi, the rapper, entrepreneur, philanthropist
              and head of the Octopizzo Foundation that bears his name reflects
              on his journey, his foundation and the Refugeenius project. His
              internationally acclaimed music album, ‘Refugeenius’ produced with
              refugee artists were played at Grønland Kirke during the Oslo Afro
              Arts Festival, alongside audiovisual materials from refugee
              musicians and paintings from Khalid Shatta. Native of Kibera, the
              largest slum in Kenya, Henry Ohanga goes by his stage name,
              Octopizzo describes his first steps in music as having been an act
              of rebellion against the world, “Music is like speaking alone but
              then everyone listens. This freedom that comes with the artist was
              everything … it was a rebellious act against people representing
              you in ways that it’s not you.” Back when he was a teenager, the
              rapper discovered his artistic abilities and their power; he
              realises that he can make himself heard and has begun a fight
              against the prejudices and stereotypes that hover above his roots.
              Later on, the work produced through his highly profiled
              humanitarian projects with UNHCR, the “Artists for Refugees” and
              “Refugeenius” projects, were also aimed to break taboos and
              stereotypes about refugees. Octopizzo is a strong advocate for
              using arts, music and sports to empower vulnerable and
              disadvantaged youth. In the humanitarian projects, he mentored
              refugees and youth. He studied social impact strategy at the
              University of Pennsylvania, and leadership at Harvard Kennedy
              University. He has also appeared on TEDX where he and other
              refugee artists presented the Refugeenius project.
            </p>
            <h4 class="small-tittle">Entrepreneurship in the Work</h4>
          </div>
          <p class="article-para">
            Music, or art in general, in his eyes, is closely linked to the
            concept of entrepreneurship. A concept he defines as “individuality
            and just believing in yourself.” Coming from a place where nobody
            was a boss, in the slum, the artist points out that “having this
            kind of mentality that you can be your own boss, not having to be
            employed, and be actually able to make a living out of something you
            love, was always such a big deal for us. All my peers were just
            looking for school and are employed after.” It is with a rebellious
            spirit that the artist pushes through in his humanitarian projects,
            to empower young artists trapped in a cacophonic environment that
            prohibits them from acknowledging their own potential or taking
            actions to build their professional paths through their passions.
            His work is a testament to believing in one’s own abilities; winning
            and being nominated for numerous national and international awards,
            such as the Grammy Awards.

          <p class="article-para">
            Entrepreneurship, in his eyes, is also closely linked with
            investment. The philanthropist admits to preferring to invest in the
            human potential, “I believe in investing in people, because when you
            invest in a person you change a whole generation […] you even spark
            another mentality in them to do that for another person, so it
            becomes like a chain of action of people who believe in other human
            beings […] Which is very rare in our society.” Having grown up in an
            environment where the idea of ​​making a living through one’s
            passion gave rise to scornful laughter. He shares intimately, “one
            person believed in me and it pushed me forward, he didn’t even need
            to invest in me but just telling me, ‘yes, you can do it’ […] he was
            my best friend and everybody else didn’t matter.”

          <h4 class="small-tittle">The Refugeenius Project</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Over the course of three albums, Octopizzo has used his platform to
            build youth projects in Kibera, Africa’s largest slum, and also in
            refugee camps across Kenya through the Octopizzo Foundation. He
            acknowledges that “what we did at the foundation are the most
            valuable things I have ever done as an artist and as a human being.”
            In 2015, he founded not-for-profit Octopizzo Foundation to realise
            the untapped potential that often resides in urban slums, rural
            areas and refugee camps through various artistic expressions,
            sports, entrepreneurship and mentorship. Through programs created by
            Octopizzo Foundation, there is an aim to liberate the
            underprivileged from “the cycle of desperation and dependency”.
            Octopizzo’s community-led approach to activism helped change the
            mentality of people and how people envision people from the slum and
            the refugee camps, he concludes that henceforth “they started to see
            us as humans.” But the road is long and the path is winding.

          <p class="article-para">
            The foundation remains dependent on donors and funders who,
            following the pandemic, have been the most affected, slowing down
            projects and programs. The rapper confesses caressing the dream of
            wanting to build “a hub one day that runs continuously, that is
            sustainable and that the community can have over and over, where
            it’s like a centre where young people can come and it becomes a path
            where they pass through as they grow and get the skills they want to
            acquire for people who can’t go to college.” In an effort to address
            and change public perception of refugees, the Refugeenius project
            was born in 2015 in collaboration with the UNHCR and under another
            common project, ‘Artists for Refugees’. The artist, aware of the
            negative connotation of the word “refugee”, emphasises the
            importance of this work in reshaping public opinion, “Refugeenius
            was about the genius part of being a refugee.” He notes that
            internally, the previous UN lead programs had focused on the
            provision of water, food, and shelter in these camps. However, over
            the years, young people found themselves frustrated at the fact of
            being withdrawn from the world and in a state of enforced
            stagnation. The artist notes that through the Refugeenius project,
            “We were able to see what art can do for them, expressing what they
            were actually going through, through their paintings, music and
            their performances, that was mind-blowing.”
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-tittle">More Than Just Music</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Although the album produced by various refugee artists remains the
            most popular aspect of the project, Octopizzo recounts that it was
            only one project among a panoply of projects offered by the program,
            “Music was just one of the things, it was a full four-year program
            on entrepreneurship, networking, marketing and just using your
            skills to grow and also survive on those streets. Most refugees get
            relocated, so we were also preparing them for their relocation, on
            matters of how to fit into society.” He clarifies that, “It was a
            very personalised program for these kids. We had 300 young people
            that participated in the program, but the ones that actually did the
            album were 18 kids, besides that we had also visual artists,
            dancers, cultural leaders and basketball players.” For Octopizzo,
            success is not defined by one way only and he “always wanted people
            to see the different ways of living.” As long as you put your mind
            to it, it will eventually pay off, “For some it takes 10 years, 1
            year or 1 month, you have to be patient. The whole point is that
            there’s not only one way to win.”

          <p class="article-para">
            The response to the hit album, ‘Refugeenius’, was amazing he
            recalls, “It was intense, and many people came out and supported
            them in many ways, it backed other programs also, other companies
            started doing similar projects. The refugee camp in Jordan wanted
            the same program and we started connecting with the refugees all
            over the world, we went to Geneva to showcase Refugeenius and it
            became bigger. I was overwhelmed because we didn’t expect it to be
            that big.” From his point of view, the direct impact of this project
            was also that these young people were able to rebuild themselves
            after their traumas. When reflecting on their journey, he notes that
            at the end, “their mindset changed, and they realized they’re not
            locked up in that camp. They have the freedom to say how they feel,
            and somewhere else in the world people are feeling like that too.
            They realized they are not alone in this and they became stronger.
            This experience has strengthened them.”

          <h4 class="small-tittle">Refugees Are Real Human Beings</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Their work for the Refugeenius project was featured at Grønland
            Kirke (translate: Grønland Church) alongside a selection of
            paintings from Sudanese Khalid Shatta during Oslo Afro Arts Festival
            in August. Audiovisual materials by musicians living in refugee
            camps in Kenya were displayed along the nave of the church, with the
            main screen displaying the Refugeenius music videos. In front of an
            international audience, the head of the foundation who mentored
            these young people wishes that their production will inspire people
            to stop treating refugees as a problem. “I want them to realize that
            these are real human beings who bring more to the table than anybody
            would ever think […] Opportunity changes everything […] When you
            don’t treat them like a problem, and when you don’t judge them based
            on their countries or what happened to them, they’re the most normal
            human beings, they might be you in another world, and they want the
            same thing, whether in the camps or the slums, they want to be
            happy, have their own house, have a family, they want to go to a
            movie and they like the same music. This is what I want this side of
            the world to see when watching some of the materials the kids did,
            realizing who they are, and stop thinking that they’re are messing
            the place up or taking over our jobs. We have an ecosystem that
            sustains itself so let those kids evolve, travel and get their
            chances.” Through his foundation, Octopizzo had conducted similar
            projects in countries like Australia with the aborigines. His dream
            is to be able to reach the refugees all over the world and let them
            be proud, and showcase their work wherever they are.
