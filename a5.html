            OSLO (August 9, 2021) – The 7th edition of the Oslo Afro Arts
            Festival (OAAF) will be held from 26-29 August 2021 in different
            venues in Grønland, Oslo, where more than 20 nationalities will be
            represented in up to 15 events over four days. The expected audience
            is 1200 at this year’s events, where various performances will be
            aimed towards children and youth.<br />Oslo Afro Arts Festival
            (OAAF) was founded in 2014 by Cecilie Giskemo, a Norwegian jazz
            vocalist and composer. The festival runs annually to celebrate
            contributions from African tradition and culture in Norway through
            art, music, food, discussions and seminars. <br />“When I left
            Africa in 2012, Zimbabwe was in turmoil, and the news only covered
            all the negative sides of the country’s situation. I felt there was
            a need to also show all the amazing stuff that was going on, and I
            focused on arts and culture. I was lucky to get involved in the arts
            and activism communities in Harare, and worked with amazing poets,
            freedom fighters, hip hop artists and musicians working with
            traditional Zimbabwean music,” says Giskemo. <br />
            Giskemo has also run several cross-cultural arts projects, teaching
            music in countries like Zimbabwe and Nepal. Giskemo and four other
            Oslo-based Zimbabweans started Zimfest in 2014 and two years later,
            expanded the concept to involve all other African countries. <br />
            “Zimfest Oslo became the Oslo Afro Arts Festival. The idea was to
            collaborate with the then called Bergen Afro Arts festival and also
            aim to expand the concept to other big cities in Norway. In that
            way, African artists travelling to Norway could tour several
            festivals, rather than just playing at one, and also, African arts
            and culture could be more visible all over Norway,” adds Giskemo.
            <br />
            OAAF aims to work in line with the guidelines of the UN goals of
            International Decade for People of African Descent through promoting
            respect, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and
            fundamental freedom for people of African origin.

          <h4 class="small-tittle">Highlights of Oslo Afro Arts Festivals</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Celebrating the diversity of art and music that is driven by African
            tradition and culture in Norway, the 2021 edition of the OAAF
            includes live concerts organised by various artists with captivating
            sounds such as BEHARIE, B Da Sufi Akuvi and Germini Orleans, which
            will be accompanied by various Afro dance workshops for children.
            <br />
            Particular highlights of the festival include also Refugee|ni|us – a
            two-part exhibition platforming refugee and former refugee artists,
            curated in collaboration with the Oslo-based former refugee painter
            Khalid Shatta. <br />
            In his paintings, the artist evokes the sensations that many
            refugees experience throughout their journey. He addresses the
            feeling of being out of place while offering us the opportunity to
            see the world through the prism that combines his memories, his
            traumas and the struggle that will hopefully lead us to appreciate
            the beauty of the world around us. <br />
            Other highlights include a lecture on decolonisation of the stage,
            taking a critical look at the function of art and culture in
            society, through Norwegian-Afro-Caribbean artist Thomas Talawa
            Prestø; and a panel discussion on being queer in Africa, as there is
            a false belief in many African countries that homosexuality is
            “un-African” and something that has been imported from the West.
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-tittle">OAAF Dedicates to Lifting Up Artists</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Giskemo was also a producer at Samspill International Music Network
            until 2019, and there she realised that there were so many amazing
            musicians from all over Africa living in Oslo and elsewhere in
            Norway. She hopes that the festival can contribute towards
            facilitating a stage for these artists. <br />
            “I hope the festival can bridge the gap between Norway and Africa,
            and be a networking platform for all kinds of artistic expressions,
            for African communities and people interested in African arts and
            culture,” says Giskemo. “I hope all African communities will get a
            sense of ownership in the festival and get more involved in
            representing different countries from the continent. Furthermore,
            people and artists that are interested in or involved with Africa
            are important contributors, both on stage or in the audience, as
            well as children and families and young people.” <br />
            In a time where COVID-19 has brought the world to an almost
            standstill with a lot of uncertainty, the Oslo Afro Arts Festival
            allows us to promote freedom of speech, human resilience, and bring
            everyone closer through the performances of African artist refugees
            and artists of African descendants living in Norway. <br />
            Director of Festival, George Daniels says, “We are taking all the
            precautions provided by Oslo Kommune and at the same time, we want
            to provide a space to lighten up the pandemic situation.” <br />
            On why the festival is important, he says “For me, it is all about
            leaving a legacy and for my children to be exposed to African
            culture. I want to be part of uplifting African culture and arts,
            and I hope through the festival, we can highlight this even more
            where it has not been done before. For example, in Africa, the topic
            of being queer is a taboo subject. So we have a special session on
            this at the festival to discuss it. Another is an exhibit where we
            want refugees to be seen as human beings through the works of
            Octopizzo. People don’t see this side often.” <br />
            OAAF is funded by Kulturrådet, Oslo Kommune, Eckbos Leget, Samspill,
            and FrittOrd; and supported by Nordic Black Theatre, Den Norske
            Kirke, Forandringshuset Grønland, Afrika.no, National museum, Løkka

            Part One – Migration of the Soul <br />
            Wednesday 25th August – Sunday 29th August 12PM-5PM at Kunsthall
            Oslo
          </h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            “Migration of the Soul” is part of a two-part exhibition platforming
            refugee and former refugee artists, curated in collaboration with
            the Oslo-based former refugee painter Khalid Shatta. The exhibition
            at Kunsthall Oslo presents the masterful paintings and sketches of
            Khalid. <br />
            When discussing the subject of migration, Khalid does not refer to
            physical migration, but to the sensation of being out of place, and
            the question of belonging in spirit. His art discusses how our
            memories, stress, trauma and depression prevent us from utilising
            our full potential, and how we can be enabled to enjoy the beautiful
            aspects of the world surrounding us. <br />
            Khalid’s work is inspired by modernist painters, but also by ancient
            civilization and culture, and highly influenced by the diverse local
            figurative style and patterns of his birthplace, Sudan. In his
            paintings, Khalid aims to portray the vast diversity of forms,
            colours, patterns, sounds and smells deriving from the country,
            looking to explore the concept of painting in different contexts,
            forms, and styles.

            “Refugee, genius,us ” is part of a two-part exhibition platforming

            Oslo-based painter and curator Khalid Shatta, will be celebrating
            the creations of otherwise marginalised artists. The title
            highlights the artistic talent that is being showcased, and the
            power of collective creation which forms the fundament of the
            exhibition project. <br />
            It is also a homage to the “Refugeenius” album, one of the
            inspirations behind this project. The album is a beautiful piece of
            art in which artists from refugee camps in Kenya collaborated with
            Octopizzo, one of Kenya’s most profiled hip-hop artists, to produce
            music pieces and videos. We now have the unique opportunity to
            showcase their work alongside the masterful paintings of Khalid
            Shatta. <br />
            Khalid’s work is inspired by modernist painters, but also by ancient
            civilization and culture, and highly influenced by the diverse local

            The photographs that are showcased in the exhibition will be
            available for purchase. The sale proceeds will be donated to
            programs of the Octopizzo Foundation which empower youth in slums
            and refugee camps in Kenya through music, arts, creativity, and
            sports.

            With a long career in the artistic world and his
            Norwegian-Afro-Caribbean background, Thomas Talawa Prestø has taken
            a critical look at the function of art and culture in society. He
            aims to discuss the necessity of having a decolonial understanding
            of non-colonial artistic and cultural expressions by elaborating
            around the epistemological differences between African and Western
            lens and cosmology.

            PANEL DISCUSSION: ROOTS – BEING QUEER IN AFRICA IS NOT UN-AFRICAN

            There is a false belief in many African countries that homosexuality
            is “un-African” and something that has been imported from the West.
            The penal codes, often inherited from the colonial era, criminalize
            homosexuality and the punishment varies from years in prison to the
            death penalty. <br />
            This panel, led by Dr. Haley McEwen, Researcher at the Centre for
            Diversity Studies and Associate Editor at the International Journal
            of Critical Diversity Studies, addresses the roots of queerness in
            African societies, how did colonialism impact the situation for
            queer African people and questions what is the way forward based on
            research that shows that in many African communities’ fluid sexual
            identities were accepted and never criminalised.
