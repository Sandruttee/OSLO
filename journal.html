              Refugee|ni|us Exhibition: Celebrating Artists from Refugee
              communities
            </h3>
            <p class="small-tittle text-justify">
              For the past decade, the word ‘refugee’ conjures negative
              connotations of being a threat or victim of war. However, refugees
              are human beings just like anyone else who dream to thrive in
              life. A two-part Refugee|ni|us exhibition that was set at two
              locations under Oslo Afro Arts Festival in August played an
              important role in platforming music and art from refugee and
              former refugee artists that Oslo residents had gotten to enjoy.
              The Refugee|ni|us exhibition is an international collaboration
              between Oslo-based curator Khalid Shatta; exhibit producer and
              cultural psychologist Mona Frank; Oslo Afro Arts Festival, and
              Octopizzo Foundation. The initiator of the exhibition, Mona Frank
              is originally from Germany and have lived in Norway for the past
              three years studying social anthropology. She found music videos
              produced by Octopizzo for the Refugeenius project and thought that
              they were amazing, [...]

              Kenyan Hip-Hop Artist Octopizzo on the Power of Music and
              Entrepreneurship
            </h3>
            <p class="small-tittle text-justify">
              From his home in Nairobi, the rapper, entrepreneur, philanthropist
              and head of the Octopizzo Foundation that bears his name reflects
              on his journey, his foundation and the Refugeenius project. His
              internationally acclaimed music album, ‘Refugeenius’ produced with
              refugee artists were played at Grønland Kirke during the Oslo Afro
              Arts Festival, alongside audiovisual materials from refugee
              musicians and paintings from Khalid Shatta. Native of Kibera, the
              largest slum in Kenya, Henry Ohanga goes by his stage name,
              Octopizzo describes his first steps in music as having been an act
              of rebellion against the world, “Music is like speaking alone but
              then everyone listens. This freedom that comes with the artist was
              everything … it was a rebellious act against people representing
              you in ways that it’s not you.” [...]
