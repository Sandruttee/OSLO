              Oslo Afro Arts Festival (OAAF) is an annual music festival
              celebrating Afro Arts: art and music deriving from African
              tradition and culture, taking place in the culturally diverse and
              vibrant atmosphere of Grønland in Oslo. Oslo Afro Arts Festival’s
              program consists of concerts, spoken-word/poetry, dance
              performances, film screenings, workshops, lectures and events for
              children and youth. We also arrange an African market with stalls,
              food, activities for children and live music. The festival is held
              across different venues in Grønland, Oslo. The festival is a
              continuation of Zimfest Oslo, a Zimbabwean music and culture
              festival that started in 2014. It aims to be a festival that
              exposes and educates all people to the individual works and
              collective contributions of African cultures. Our mission is
              addressed through our flagship activity: the festival, and through
              other activities that promote African arts and culture in Norway.
              Oslo Afro Arts Festival is designed to create an open and
              inclusive festival where African culture can be experienced
              through art, music, food, discussion, information and interaction.
              Furthermore, OAAF aim to strengthen international music scene in
              Oslo and inspire artists to collaborate across ethnic and cultural
              affiliations
