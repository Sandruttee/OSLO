          <p class="article-para">
            From Sudan to Oslo, Khalid Shatta’s recent paintings “Migration of
            the Soul” were shown at Kunsthall Oslo and Grønland Kirke under the
            Oslo Afro Arts Festival for a two-part exhibition to showcase the
            work of refugee artists. Kunsthall Oslo, a non-profit art space
            located at the heart of Bjørvika which explores the social and
            historical context of contemporary art production, had featured
            Shatta’s large canvas masterpieces and sketches in their gallery.
            <br />
            Painting has always been living inside Khalid Shatta and he
            professed that it is the only language he has known. He believes
            that painting was a way for him to understand his childhood and also
            perhaps as a healing tool. “We were poor and we could not afford to
            buy paints or anything. We lift our finger up in the sky and draw a
            fish.” Children, he said have creativity. “I don’t think a lot about
            having materials to express my feeling. I can FEEL it.” <br />
            In person, Khalid is soft-spoken and pensive, yet his bolts of
            laughter at times lightened the souls around him. He fled Sudan,
            arriving in Norway nine years ago and now holds Norwegian
            citizenship. He voted recently in the Norwegian general election,
            something he would not do in his home country as he does not trust
            the government. Shatta keeps most of his personal life story private
            and doesn’t like to mix it with his artwork. Even when he won the
            2012 Education For All: Global Monitoring Report on Youth, Skills
            and Work art contest, and was rewarded a trip to Paris to meet the
            team. There no one knew about him or his childhood hardship on the
            streets. They only knew him through his art. <br />
            Reflecting back on the trip to Paris, he paused, in tears with mixed
            feelings and empathy, “I feel sad because what about my home? What
            about my people? Why is it hard? This is painful.” At the heart of
            his work is a desire to change the world. He saw how knowledge and
            education changed society, and wanted the same for his people in
            Sudan. <br />
            Shatta raised questions about our sense of belonging and mental
            health, drawing attention to our own disconnection with nature,
            people, the universe and the wisdom that was passed down from
            ancient civilisations. Through his paintings, “Migration of the
            Soul”, he was not referring to the physical migration but rather
            “the sensation of being out of place or not at home,” and “where we
            belong in spirit.”

          <p class="article-para">
            “We live in a time where many people feel a disconnection to their
            own bodies and existence. The works of “Migration of the Soul” take
            as their subject matter our understanding of ourselves and the
            universe in which we are living,” said Shatta to Oslo Afro Arts
            Festival. <br />
            Before moving to Europe, Shatta had a positive image of Europe and
            US, being the best places to live for anyone because of the supposed
            equality and freedom that can be found, “People seemed happier
            there. So, when I came to Europe, the image totally changed. I get a
            lot of things here where I haven’t dreamed about. […] But at the
            same time, […] It was my first time that I got to know what stress
            means. I didn’t know that in my country. Despite the war and
            everything, we were happy in a way. I felt like, there is humanity
            in Africa, whilst here it is low.” He believed that we can live
            together if we only open our hearts.
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-tittle">Body, Nature and Soul</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            His art also discussed how our memories, stress, trauma and
            depression prevented us from utilising our full potential and from
            enjoying the beautiful aspects of the world. Through migrating to
            Europe, he started to understand why people had attempted to take
            their own lives and had similar thoughts himself. <br />
            “I feel like we are artificial beings in this universe. Because my
            story in life is really hard. No one can imagine it. But everyone
            has a story. Sometimes I can’t believe how it goes. Imagine someone
            who left his country because of war. […] And then some are here.
            Some of us became a victim in their own stories. I have a lot on my
            mind. Like stress and trauma, and also, I get really depressed too.
            It happened to me too. It makes me understand other people’s choice
            too.” <br />
            Shatta has tried to find peace within himself through art. He
            believes that help should be given to those who need it and we
            should thank ourselves for doing good things, “We need to look to
            the other side of life that is beautiful.” <br />
            For him, the paintings were a way for him to continue where his
            ancestors have started as they always used “art to reflect the
            beauty of their time.” Shatta fondly spoke and praised his ancestors
            and the ancient civilisation where they didn’t have the kind of
            resources that we have today to build the pyramids, and how
            respectful they were with mother nature. <br />
            “If you look at the ancient people they made something that we are
            now enjoying it. I feel like we have more access, more than them. We
            can make something more than that.” He playfully imagined the idea
            of people in the past coming to the present moment, and seeing what
            humankind has created, they would be wowed he thought.
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-tittle">Motifs in his paintings</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Weaving into his paintings are motifs that are deeply symbolic and
            represent deep cultural meanings anchored in his inspirations from
            ancient civilisations and his birthplace Sudan – its history and
            culture. The technique and style drew upon modernist painters, such
            as Hussein Gamaan, Kerry James Marshall, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Paul
            Klee, as well as photographers like Malick Sidibé, Seydou Keïta and
            Gordon Parks. <br />
            The motifs in his paintings drew attention to these inspirations
            that were close to his heart and he wanted people to “dig deep into
            themselves” and how they were functioning in society. As a Nuba
            descendent, he tried to uncover his cultural heritage and identity
            that was lost under Islamic rule and European colonialism. <br />
            “I make use of ancient Kemetic and Cushitic symbols from the
            historical kingdoms of the Nile valley civilisations. I believe that
            everything is connected through our shared history, even in this
            chaotic state of migration,” said Shatta to Kunsthall Oslo. <br />
            Khalid Shatta is a nickname he goes by, and the meaning of ‘Shatta’
            draws from a hot spicy sauce found in Sudan and many countries in
            the Middle East. Shatta is also an African Nuba name used socially
            in the regions of the Nuba mountainous, Gambia, Ghana, Mali and
            Senegal. He chuckled at the multi-layered meaning of his nickname.
            <br />
            In one of his paintings, he pointed out the motifs of the mask and
            time, “because for me everything is all about time. We wear the mask
            within time. […] I’m trying to reveal what is behind the mask. I’m
            trying to show what is behind that, and also especially for example
            in Sudan, we have a lot of identity issues. For me, I think it is
            important to think about that. People came to enslave us, I can say
            that because it is part of history.” <br />
            He read aloud his beloved quote from John Henrik Clarke, “History is
            not everything, but it is a starting point. History is a clock that
            people use to tell their political and cultural time of day. It is a
            compass they use to find themselves on the map of human geography.
            It tells them where they are but, more importantly, what they must
            be.”

            John Henrik Clarke is a professor, well-known for pioneering
            Africana Studies, and for studying and documenting the histories and
            contributions from Africans and the African diaspora at the time of
            prevailing Eurocentric views in academia. <br />
            “I love that [quote] because if we know who we are, we know where we
            belong. Also, I believe that in this generation, this is
            particularly important because of the demonstration for George
            Floyd. […] I went to Stortinget (translate: Norwegian parliament)
            and I feel like the oldest one at the protest. This is beautiful.”
            <br />
            Seeing younger generations joining the protest, “I feel like we are
            in good times. I feel like we have a revolution. […] I felt that
            these people standing there, are making the world a better place.
            […] I felt like those generations, they will one day be in charge in
            this country.”

            Another motif he paid homage to in his painting is ‘Sudan’ – the
            last existing male northern white rhinoceros, who passed away in
            2018. He wanted to explore how it would feel to be the last standing
            animal in the universe, and at the same time examine the bond
            between people and nature, especially living in concerning times of
            climate change and environmental pollution. <br />
            “Humans are really far away from nature, from animal, and even
            because of us, it no longer lives. […] I also use cactus in my
            painting, because the way it looks, sometimes it can be scary for
            some people but cactus has the most beautiful flowers you can see.
            Also, it can save you if you are lost in the desert. […] People also
            use it for healing,” he expanded.
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-tittle">The Garden of Colours and Diversity</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            When asked about the colour palettes he chose, he said, “Imagine you
            have a garden and only white flowers, you get stressed with one
            colour, but if you have a garden full of colours you will enjoy it.
            This is what it means to be together; This is the meaning of
            diversity.” He believes that art is to connect, and used the garden
            metaphorically to describe his experience at Oslo Afro Arts
            Festival, “It means something, not just for Africans. This is a
            garden of flowers because you see the diversity. It’s beautiful. I
            feel like we are here, not WE ARE HERE. What we are doing, people
            need to see that.” <br />
            This was the first time that Shatta participated at the Oslo Afro
            Arts Festival, and got to meet other Sudanese as well as Sudan’s
            ambassador. He doesn’t want to just represent Sudan, but every human
            being, “Because we need each other. We have enough. Our ego makes us
            blind sometimes.” <br />
            He hoped that one day people will see and heal themselves through
            his art, “I am trying to create a safe space where they can feel
            calm. I don’t want them to think that I created all these beautiful
            paintings. But I need them to question themselves. Why are we here?
            Because it is important. Who you are? What is your purpose in life?
            Because we are all a part of history. We are making history.
            Everyone can try to write their name in history. You can be the
            worse one or the good one.” <br />
            Shatta showed me another painting, “This painting, it’s an ear,
            listening to the universe. You can see here that we connect
            together. I like to be at a higher place. I feel like I am owning
            the world. It is good sometimes to see ourselves that way. No one
            [else] can give that to us.” <br />
            Shatta often got asked whether he got inspired by “Norwegian this
            and that” and he told them, “[…] yes I did get inspired, but we
            don’t have to take it as figures or colours. Because I am in Norway,
            I am able to create this in this safe space. Because of this, I made
            this. There is always inspiration everywhere.”
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-tittle">Art – a Double-edged sword for Shatta</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            A threat came to him and his family that changed the trajectory of
            his life in 2012 and solidified his move to Europe. An exhibit in
            Sudan that invited the British ambassador to see his photos of the
            beauty of the Nabu mountains where he grew up was a sensitive
            region. After being expelled from university, he realised just how
            serious the situation was. However, his childhood hardship and
            political threats didn’t stop Khalid Shatta from pursuing his art.
            He applied to numerous art contests and won one, sending him to
            Paris for the launch of the report, 2012 EFA Global Monitoring
            Report on Youth, Skills and Work, which was mentioned before. <br />
            For Shatta, art never disappointed him, even in troubled time, “Art
            can put you in trouble, and it can also save you. Through art, I’m
            trying to change the world.” <br />
            In the future, Shatta said he will continue working on his theme
            “Migration of the Soul” to introduce sculptures and performing art
            into this body of work, “I think there is more to come. Art is
            bigger than my own imagination. I feel that something is coming.” He
            added further, “The future is always bright when we understand our
            time.”
