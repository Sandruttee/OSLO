              Refugee|ni|us Exhibition: Celebrating Artists from Refugee
              communities
            </h3>
            <img src="images/a0.png" class="workshop-img" />
            <p class="small-italic">- words by Ka Man Mak</p>
            <p class="article-para">
              For the past decade, the word ‘refugee’ conjures negative
              connotations of being a threat or victim of war. However, refugees
              are human beings just like anyone else who dream to thrive in
              life. A two-part Refugee|ni|us exhibition that was set at two
              locations under Oslo Afro Arts Festival in August played an
              important role in platforming music and art from refugee and
              former refugee artists that Oslo residents had gotten to enjoy.
              The Refugee|ni|us exhibition is an international collaboration
              between Oslo-based curator Khalid Shatta; exhibit producer and
              cultural psychologist Mona Frank; Oslo Afro Arts Festival, and
              Octopizzo Foundation. The initiator of the exhibition, Mona Frank
              is originally from Germany and have lived in Norway for the past
              three years studying social anthropology. She found music videos
              produced by Octopizzo for the Refugeenius project and thought that
              they were amazing, “I thought it’s a shame that only few people
              know about them. It’s out there. The artists were easily
              accessible. […] So, for me it became really important to create a
              platform where this art can be shown and working with Khalid
              Shatta who is an amazing artist, incredibly talented, and was
              incredibly helpful in making this project happen. The project
              became like a baby for me. It’s so great to see it happen. I think
              it is important to try those things despite the pandemic and the
              circumstances we live in; to find ways to showcase art and to make
              it more accessible and more known.”

            First Part – “Migration of the Soul” Paintings
          </h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            The first part of the exhibition title “Migration of the Soul”
            featured Sudanese painter, Khalid Shatta’s large canvas paintings
            and sketches at Kunsthall Oslo. Shatta was not referring to physical
            migration when discussing the theme for his paintings, but rather
            the sensation of being out of place and questioning spiritual
            belonging. In so doing, he highlights how our mental state, like
            memories, stress, trauma, and depression can prevent us from
            utilising our full potential and enjoying the beautiful aspects of
            the world. Weaving into his paintings are motifs that are deeply
            symbolic and represented deep cultural meanings anchored in his
            inspirations from ancient civilisation and his birthplace Sudan –
            its history and culture. The technique and style drew upon modernist
            painters, such as Hussein Gamaan, Kerry James Marshall, Jean-Michel
            Basquiat, Paul Klee, as well as photographers like Malick Sidibé,
            Seydou Keïta and Gordon Parks. “I hope that one day, people will see
            and heal themselves through my art,” said Khalid Shatta, who saw art
            saving him. “I am trying to create a safe space where they can feel
            calm. I don’t want them to think that I created all these beautiful
            paintings. But I need them to question themselves. Why are we here?
            Because it is important. Who you are? What is your purpose in life?
            Because we are all a part of history. We are making history.
            Everyone can try to write their name in history. You can be the
            worse one or the good one.”

            Second Part – Refugee|ni|us – Refugee, genius, us
          </h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            The second part of the exhibition titled, “Refugee, genius, us” was
            featured at Grønland Kirke (translate: Grønland Church) where a
            selection of Khalid Shatta’s paintings and audiovisual materials by
            musicians living in refugee camps in Kenya were displayed. The title
            of this exhibition paid homage to the music album “Refugeenius”
            which was produced by Octopizzo in collaboration with numerous
            refugee artists from the Demoncratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,
            Burundi, Uganda, Somalia and South Sudan. The album was part of the
            “Artists for Refugees” project that was run by UNHCR Kenya and the
            Octopizzo Foundation. Along the nave of the church was lined up of
            photographs, leading up to a big screen where music videos were
            played on repeat. QR codes were found on the photographs and the
            exhibition’s roll-ups were near the entrance. The QR codes sent the
            curious to more information about Octopizzo Foundation and the
            information of the musicians. The photographs that were showcased in
            the exhibition were available for purchase. The sales of photographs
            will be donated to the programs of the Octopizzo Foundation which
            empower youth in slums and refugee camps in Kenya through music,
            arts, creativity, and sports. For more than two years, Octopizzo
            worked with over 300 artists to produce songs and music videos. The
            aim of “Refugeenius” project was to nurture the talent that exists
            in refugee camps and to mentor youth, so that they can attain
            sustainable livelihoods through their talents. “I want them to
            realize that these are real human beings who bring more to the table
            than anybody would ever think […] Opportunity changes everything […]
            When you don’t treat them like a problem, and when you don’t judge
            them based on their countries or what happened to them, they’re the
            most normal human beings. They might be you in another world, and
            they want the same thing, whether in the camps or the slums, they
            want to be happy, have their own house, have a family, they want to
            go to a movie and they like the same music. This is what I want this
            side of the world to see when watching some of the materials the
            kids did, realizing who they are, and stop thinking that they’re are
            messing the place or taking over our jobs. We have an ecosystem that
            sustains itself so let those kids evolve, travel and get their
            chances.”

          <h4 class="small-tittle">Enriching Society Through Talent</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Mona Frank said, “We need to stop being bound by fear. And we need
            to start seeing the beauty and richness of people who come here.” In
            light of the recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban and the
            Norwegian general election, she believed that the topic of refugees
            won’t go away and refugees should be seen as enriching society
            through their talents and not as a financial burden. The exhibition
            was the answer to that by showcasing talented people and how society
            can benefit from having them here.
