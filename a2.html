            The Oslo Desk sat down with three dancers during the Oslo Afro Arts
            Festival to discuss briefly what dance they were teaching and what
            it meant to them. <br />
            African or Africana dance is a spiritual practice to communicate
            with the universe and for finding one’s own identity, as we have
            learned from the lecture by Thomas Talawa Prestø. Hear what these
            dancers have to say.

            Nasser Mhende, Afro House dance instructor
          </h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Zimbabwe professional dancer and singer songwriter, Nasser Mhende
            came to Norway in 2007 to study modern dance at Kunsthøgskolen in
            Oslo. He is currently running an artistic organisation called, ‘One
            Mic’, a collective of dancers and actors to create music events.
            During the Oslo Afro Arts Festival, Nasser and his co-instructor,
            Thulani Maluleka, held a youth workshop to teach Afro House dance
            steps. <br />
            Afro House dance is South African, and is practiced in celebratory
            events, such as weddings and birthday parties, “It’s a rhythm that
            everyone knows about. South African dance is very rhythmic, everyone
            listens to the rhythms and they move to the rhythms in any way they
            like, to use their upper body but mostly the feet that follow the
            same rhythm.” For Nasser, the dance he taught was more urban. <br />
            “Everything is in the feet. You have shakers on the feet as well.
            […] When you go up North [in Africa], its more to do with the body,
            where you can’t break it, you have to keep to the same body
            movements rhythmically. Whilst with Afro, like the one we are doing
            [at the workshop], it’s based on the traditional rhythm steps but
            it’s modernised.” <br />
            For Nasser, “Dance means freedom. Freedom of expression. Freedom of
            movement. Freedom of the body. So, it’s like body therapy. To keep
            your body loose.” Through dance, he wanted to bring joy and fun to
            those who wish to learn from him.

            Thulani Maluleka, Afro House dance instructor
          </h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            South African dancer and trumpeter, Thulani Maluleka first visited
            Norway in 1999 through an exchange program between Norway and South
            Africa organised by the Field Band Foundation where they aimed to
            teach kids music and life skills. He held a workshop for youths in
            Norway and was later asked to return to do more. He has now been
            residing in Norway for four years with his family. <br />
            The name ‘Thulani’, he started, means to be quiet and enjoy life,
            which matched with his big smile and jovial nature. For the
            workshop, he said “We mainly focus on simple movements. […] We turn
            it to a smooth and nice dance. You know, shaking your body and
            enjoying yourself.” <br />
            For Thulani, “Dance means equality. […] We can speak different
            languages but when we come to dance, we don’t speak anything. We do
            the same movements. It’s like when we dance together, we feel equal.
            It also means freedom for me. It is where we express ourselves when
            it comes to dancing.” <br />
            Dance is also used in protests, not because of joy, Thulani
            explained, but rather “dance is the way we do things.”

          <h4 class="small-tittle">Jomo Masai, Samba dance instructor</h4>
          <p class="article-para">
            Brazilian professional dancer and choreographer, Jomo Masai started
            dancing when he was only three years old. Since then, Jomo has had a
            long and successful career in dance and performing arts, and has
            travelled around the world teaching and performing samba and other
            dance styles. Jomo came to Norway in August 2012, after an intensive
            working period in Brazil, and Norway seemed to be a nice place for
            him to recharge for a while. He is passionate about teaching and
            believes that everyone has something unique and magical to offer,
            once you dare to be yourself. <br />
            Samba dance while rooted in Brazil, originated from influences of
            West African dance practices that were brought to Brazil during the
            Portuguese colonisation. When people think about samba, they think
            about the carnival said Jomo, so this is what he tried to emulate in
            his workshop; connecting it to party without having to inject
            something. He also wanted his students to become observers to
            reflect on what they could see and to dig deeper to find their
            innate samba dance. <br />
            “Dance is a feeling. Samba is just another way to express feeling.
            So, I like it when people learn different styles in order to
            increase their body movements’ vocabulary, body awareness and
            intelligence, cultural tolerance, understanding and respect […]. But
            in Samba, you can get and give much more of your energy. Your
            happiness. Or strength through movements. It’s high tempo. High
            speed. But it can also be smooth, slow and extremely elegant. […]”
            <br />
            For Jomo, he has learned a lot of things through Samba and it
            allowed him to understand why dance is so important, “I can see the
            movements, and I let the movements come into me. Samba tells the
            history of my Afro-Brazilian cultural heritage and it runs through
            my veins, it shows in my body language, you can see it through the
            colour of my skin, in my smile, and in my heartbeat. And even in my
            deepest silence, there is a constant movement. My body and soul
            dance when I’m sleeping and move when I’m awake!” By travelling
            around the world and sharing his own culture, he has gotten to learn
            about other cultures and developed a non-judgemental mindset. <br />
            “Dance is a non-verbal expression. It connects everything.
            Everything that doesn’t have a voice. Doesn’t have a sound.” People
            connect through movements. “Eye contact is dance. Touching is dance.
            Just touching without eyes is dance. Looking into each other without
            touching is dance. Dance is everywhere. And it is connecting
            everything.”
